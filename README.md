# TeamA_Maven
This repository is a simple Maven project that leverages the Maven assembly plugin for packaging a SOAtest project as a zip artifact to be published to your artifactory.  This repository assumes sufficient knowledge of Maven to adapt these settings to publish your own projects to your artifactory.
